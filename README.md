🚀 Full-Stack Authentication System — Scalable, Secure, and Smooth
This project is a complete user authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It's designed to provide a real-world, production-ready auth experience, with a clean, modern UI and secure backend logic.

🛠️ Technologies Used
🧠 Backend (Node.js + Express)
Node.js & Express – for building a RESTful API

MongoDB & Mongoose – to store user data and session tokens

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – for secure token-based authentication

bcryptjs – to hash passwords securely

Mailtrap – for sending real email verification codes (OTP-based)

Cookie-based sessions – to maintain user authentication status

Express middleware – to protect routes and handle email verification flow

🎨 Frontend (React)
React 19 – latest version for modern, fast, and modular UI

Zustand – for lightweight global state management (auth state, user info, loading/error states)

React Router v7 – to manage client-side navigation and protected routing

Tailwind CSS – for a fully responsive, elegant UI design

Framer Motion – for smooth animations and transitions

Lucide React – for modern iconography

React Hot Toast – to show stylish real-time notifications

✨ Features
✅ Sign Up with full name, email, password, and unique username

✅ Email Verification (6-digit OTP code) before account activation

✅ Login with secure cookie-based session tracking

✅ Password Reset Page "on working"

🧑‍💻 Why I Built This
Authentication is a core feature in nearly every web application. I built this project to master the entire flow — from database schema design, to token handling, to frontend form UX — and make it scalable and developer-friendly.

This system can easily be integrated into larger apps such as e-commerce platforms, dashboards, or SaaS products.
